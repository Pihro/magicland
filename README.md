# Magic Land

Magic Land is an attempt to convert [TMW][] code to based on Manaserv,
but don't intent to be thorouly identical.

[TMW]: https://github.com/themanaworld

This is a project for fun and I don't have a server to host it, so no
guarantee it'll be finished.

I have a few ideas to add to [TMW][] or even change the way something works,
so I'll do so. And maybe if I have more ideas in the future, I'll make it a
thorouly different game world.

Anyone offer help is appreciated, including offer server to host it or add
new maps and new scripts to it and add other arts to it, and so on.
